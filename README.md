A while ago a tweeted that I had fixed the internet.

Well, I guess that wasn't entirely accurate.
I gave people the ability for _them_ to fix the internet, but not everyone was on board.

So today, I'm making it even easier for you to fix your little corner of the interwebs.

## Get the code (i.e. fix the internet)

All you have to do is this:

```shell
$ npm i --save undefined-is-a-function
```

(or if you like yarn)
```shell
$ yarn add undefined-is-a-function
```

Then in your code:

```js
import { undefined } from 'undefined-is-a-function';
```

Fixed! `undefined` is now a function.

So I state again: ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ I fixed the internet! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

_(or at least until the next time)_

## Tests

Yes, there are tests. And they all pass.
